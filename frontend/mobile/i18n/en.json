    "text": "The tool Future of Work allows you to plan your visits to the office in an easy and intuitive way. Simply by indicating the date and place within a present or future period you can book a seat. The concept of \"landing zones\" enables specific teams or units to work close to each other. As all desks might not have the same equipment, the filter function allows you to search according to your preference, for example, the number of monitors. Any user can schedule visits for the sites included in the tool. The tool gives an overview of your reservations and those of your team, and even displays who is sitting next to you. In the report section you can access data on desk utilisation and the tool further offers an overview of first aiders booked in the office",
