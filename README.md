# Future of Work

### Modes of running

#### dev profile
```
cd backend
npm run serve
```

```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

#### prod profile

```
docker-compose build --parallel --pull --force-rm
docker-compose up
```
### Get started

You need the [Node.js package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) for development. Then follow these rules:

```
git clone
cd future-of-work
npm i
npm run serve
```
This will start your API in __development mode__. In contrast, the live version runs in production mode.
